# Collision Avoidance
This repository is a project for an assignment given to me from the school I attend (DAE, Digital Arts & Entertainment, major Game Development), where I had to choose a research topic of my choice to implement on an AI.
In the courses we already saw Seeking, Face, Arrive, Fleeing, Wandering, Evade and Pursue as the basic behaviors for an AI. Collision avoidance is a useful one for future projects.
